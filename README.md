# Milestone project 1

## Project Summary

This is my online CV for my role as a Full-stack Web Developer, built as my firts milestone project for the Code Institute Full-Stack developer course. 

This portfolio is designed to show to potential employers and collaborators. The portfolio highlights the skills that i have gained on this course, as well as other skills that i have developed in other roles and soft skills that i can bring to the table. 

My goal with this project was to create a clean and minimal single page aplication, with drop down sections to learn more about different aspects of me. The tone here was professional, aiming at potential employers, but to also show a little of my personality and give users a bit of an idea about the kind of person i am.

## UX

My UX process centered on a mobile first, clean and responsive design. I wanted to keep the page as clean as possible, but esilly scale and respond to the user. 

### User Stories
* Employers, who want to get an overview of my skills and experience, before potentially hiring me.
* Collaborators, who would be interested in seeing other things i have worked on, before potentially deciding to work with me.
